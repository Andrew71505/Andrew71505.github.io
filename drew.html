<br><br>
I know you moved onto someone new
<br>
Hope life is beautiful
<br>
You were the light for me to find my truth
<br>
I just wanna say, thank you
<br>
<br><br> 
Leaving to find my soul
<br>
Told her I had to go
<br>
And I know it ain't pretty
<br>
When our hearts get broke
<br>
Too young to feel this old
<br>
Watching us both turn cold
<br>
Oh, I know it ain't pretty
<br>
When two hearts get broke
<br>
Yeah, I know it ain't pretty
<br>
When two hearts get broke
<br>
<br><br>
I hope someday we'll sit down together
<br>
And laugh with each other about these days, these days
<br>
All our troubles, we'll lay to rest and
<br>
We'll wish we could come back to these days, these days
<br>
<br><br>
Oh, I know, I know
<br>
Oh, I know, I know
<br>
Oh, I know, I know
<br>
These days, these days
<br>
<br>
Oh, I know, I know
<br>
Oh, I know, I know
<br>
Oh, I know, I know
<br>
These days, these days
<br>
<br><br>
Three years of ups and downs
<br>
Nothing to show for it now
<br>
And I know it ain't pretty
<br>
When the fire burns out
<br>
Calling me when I'm drunk
<br>
Remind me of what I've done
<br>
And I know it ain't pretty
<br>
When you're trying to move on, yeah
<br>
<br><br>
I hope someday we'll sit down together
<br>
And laugh with each other about these days, these days
<br>
All our troubles, we'll lay to rest and
<br>
We'll wish we could come back to these days, these days
<br>
<br><br>
Oh, I know, I know
<br>
Oh, I know, I know
<br>
Oh, I know, I know
<br>
These days, these days
<br>
<br>
Oh, I know, I know
<br>
Oh, I know, I know
<br>
Oh, I know, I know
<br>
To these days, these days, oh
<br>
<br><br>
Cigarettes in the ash tray
<br>
Reminiscing on those past days
<br>
I thought you'd end up with my last name
<br>
But that changed
<br>
<br><br>
And I travelled around the world, think where you living at now?
<br>
I heard you moved to Austin, got a new apartment and settled down
<br>
And every once in a while I start texting
<br>
Write a paragraph, but then I delete the message
<br>
<br><br>
Think 'bout you like a past time
<br>
I could cry you a river, get you baptised or
<br>
I wasn't ready to act right
<br>
Used to always think I'd get you back, right
<br>
<br><br>
They say that things fall apart (Yeah)
<br>
We were gonna move to Brooklyn, you were gonna study Art
<br>
Love is just a tool to remind us who we are
<br>
And that we are not alone when we're walking in the dark
<br>
<br><br>
I hope someday we'll sit down together
<br>
And laugh with each other about these days, these days
<br>
All our troubles, we'll lay to rest and
<br>
We'll wish we could come back to these days, these days
<br>
<br><br>
We'll wish we could come back to these days, these days
